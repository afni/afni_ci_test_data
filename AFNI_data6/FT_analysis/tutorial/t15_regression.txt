Processing block: regress

This is the main step in the single subject analysis - regressing the data
against our model.

Background:

   Our regression model is made of a few simple parts:

      1. a polynomial baseline, meant to account for the mean of the scan
         and for slow baseline drifts

      2. responses to stimuli of interest

      3. motion parameters, meant to account for residual motion effects that
         3dvolreg cannot perfectly correct

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The proc.FT script:

      3dDeconvolve -input pb04.$subj.r??.scale+orig.HEAD                   \
          -polort 3                                                        \
          -num_stimts 8                                                    \
          -stim_times 1 stimuli/AV1_vis.txt 'BLOCK(20,1)'                  \
          -stim_label 1 Vrel                                               \
          -stim_times 2 stimuli/AV2_aud.txt 'BLOCK(20,1)'                  \
          -stim_label 2 Arel                                               \
          -stim_file 3 dfile.rall.1D'[0]' -stim_base 3 -stim_label 3 roll  \
          -stim_file 4 dfile.rall.1D'[1]' -stim_base 4 -stim_label 4 pitch \
          -stim_file 5 dfile.rall.1D'[2]' -stim_base 5 -stim_label 5 yaw   \
          -stim_file 6 dfile.rall.1D'[3]' -stim_base 6 -stim_label 6 dS    \
          -stim_file 7 dfile.rall.1D'[4]' -stim_base 7 -stim_label 7 dL    \
          -stim_file 8 dfile.rall.1D'[5]' -stim_base 8 -stim_label 8 dP    \
          -gltsym 'SYM: Vrel -Arel'                                        \
          -glt_label 1 V-A                                                 \
          -fout -tout -x1D X.xmat.1D -xjpeg X.jpg                          \
          -fitts fitts.$subj                                               \
          -errts errts.$subj                                               \
          -bucket stats.$subj

   The input to 3dDeconvolve is the list of 'scale' datasets.  Note that the
   -input option is given pb04.$subj.r??.scale+orig.HEAD as its parameter.
   This wildcard expression (the '??' characters mean exactly 2 characters as
   a match pattern) matches any files that start with pb04.$subj, followed by
   'r' and any 2 characters (numbers in our case), and with a trailing suffix
   of '.scale+orig.HEAD'.

   Test this on the command line in 2 ways, using the 'echo' command and the
   'ls' command:

        set subj = FT

        echo pb04.$subj.r??.scale+orig.HEAD
        ls -l pb04.$subj.r??.scale+orig.HEAD

   We first make sure that the $subj variable is set as it is in the script.
   The 'echo' command lists the files on one line, while 'ls' shows one file
   per line.

   Remember that since we are using wildcards to match filenames, we must 
   provide details for a complete filename match (i.e. including either .HEAD
   or .BRIK).  If the inputs were listed as pb04.$subj.r??.scale+orig, there
   would be a "No match" error since the shell would not find any files that
   match our pattern.

   Note that it is as if we listed all 3 runs on the command line:

        3dDeconvolve -input pb04.FT.r01.scale+orig.HEAD \
                            pb04.FT.r02.scale+orig.HEAD \
                            pb04.FT.r03.scale+orig.HEAD \
                     ...

   Providing 3dDeconvolve with 3 datasets tells the program that there are 3
   runs, with the number of TRs in each run contained in that input dataset.
   If we had concatenated them into one dataset, we would need to add the
   -concat option to tell 3dDeconvolve where the run breaks occur.

    ---

    The next 2 pairs of options specifies regressors of interest.  The first
    pair is for the 'visual-reliable' stimulus class.

        -stim_times 1 stimuli/AV1_vis.txt 'BLOCK(20,1)' \
        -stim_label 1 Vrel

    This tells 3dDeconvolve that at each time in stimuli/AV1_vis.txt, there
    should be a BOLD response to a 20 second stimulus.  Each convolved BOLD
    response would last for approximately 35 seconds.

 ** Please see the next file in the tutorial for details on understanding the
    X-matrix, and how it is created from the inputs to 3dDeconvolve.

    ---

    The next 6 lines of options are to specify the motion parameters.  Since
    volume registration (3dvolreg) cannot possibly correct the subject motion,
    it is important to still account for motion in the regression.  Voxel time
    series should not show significance for a regressor of interest if the
    similarity to that regressor is based on motion.  These regressors are
    included as a precaution.

    Advanced:
 
        Note that it is a good idea to censor any TRs with significant motion.
        Recall from the 'volreg' section that a motion_${subj}_enorm.1D file
        was created to show per-TR motion as a single time series.
 
        If the user applies -regress_censor_motion (as is done in s02.ap.align,
        the more advanced afni_proc.py command), then 1d_tool.py will be used
        to create a censor file just before 3dDeconvolve.  See the 'regress'
        block in the advanced script (s12.proc.FT.align) for details.

    Following the regressors we have the single GLT (general linear test)
    specification that we told afni_proc.py to pass on to 3dDeconvolve.

        -gltsym 'SYM: Vrel -Arel'       \
        -glt_label 1 V-A                \

    The symbolic contrast is the visual beta minus the audio beta, and is given
    label V-A.

    The last options are as follows:

        -fout -tout -x1D X.xmat.1D -xjpeg X.jpg                          \
        -fitts fitts.$subj                                               \
        -errts errts.$subj                                               \
        -bucket stats.$subj

    The -fout and -tout options tell 3dDeconvolve to output F-stats and t-stats
    when appropriate.

    The -x1D option specifies the name of the file to write the X-matrix to in
    text form, while -xjpeg specifies a name to write the image version to.
    Both files represent the X-matrix, but they give different perspectives.

    The last 3 options are for output datasets.  The -fitts dataset is shows
    the model fit to the data as well as possible.  The -errts dataset is the
    error time series data, or residuals.  It equals the input minus the fitts.
    The final option, -bucket, specifies where 3dDeconvolve should write all of
    the beta weights and statistical volumes to.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** At this point it might be a good idea to review the next tutorial file on
    the X-matrix.  That will help understand the data output from 3dDeconvolve
    which will be reviewed in the remainder of this file.

    The order is a little thrown off, but it seemed like a good idea to cover
    the X-matrix in a single file.

View the results in the afni GUI:

   At this point, controller [A] (the windows across the top of the screen)
   should be showing dataset pb02.FT.r01.scale+orig and controller [B] should
   be showing pb01.FT.r01.blur.  The coordinates should be (19.3 78 -5.7).

   First, let us just find some results.  Close controller B.

        - [B] : done, done
