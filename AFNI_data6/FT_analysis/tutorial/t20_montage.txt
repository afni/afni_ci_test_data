View clustered results using a montage.

Background:

   We have thresholded and clustered the data.  Now display an axial montage,
   creating an image that is often nice for publication.  The goal is to show
   activation across the entire (or portion of the) brain, but in one image.

===========================================================================

View the results in the afni GUI.

   Set the underlay to be the anatomy and the overlay (both OLay and Thr) to be
   the V-A contrast t-statistic.  Use the default clustering (20 voxels) for 
   this example, and view the data from the same voxel at (52, 3.6, 12).

   The current settings should be:
        Ulay:   FT_anat+orig
        Olay:   stats.FT+orig   sub-brick 8 (V-A t-stat)
        Thr:                    sub-brick 8 (V-A t-stat)

        threshold = 7.0
        clusterize (default 20 voxels)
        jump-to-xyz: 52 3.6 12

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Note that we just selected an image that we like.  With any input data, the
   montage steps could be performed.  Just preferably start with a pretty
   picture being displayed and the crosshairs at a useful coordinate.
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

   In the axial image window, open a montage of 3x4 images, spaced every 4
   slices.

        - Axial window: click "Mont" (next to Done on the bottom)
        - select Across=3, Down=4, Spacing=4
        - Axial montage control: set Border=2, Color=dk-blue
        - Draw

   Note the crosshairs still on the current slice.  For a better idea of which
   slices are being displayed, look at either the sagittal or corolal windows.
   Notice there are now 12 green horizontal lines representing the 12 slices
   being shown in the axial montage.

   Some additional features:

   1. View only the single crosshair in the sagittal and coronal image windows.
      Note that they can be turned off all together.  In the upper left corner
      of the main controller window, change the Xhairs value from Multi to 
      either Single or Off.

        - main controller: Xhairs: Multi -> Single

   2. Get rid of the blue border between images, just to see the difference.

        - Axial montage control: set Border=0, Color=none (either is enough)
        - Draw

   3. Save and view the image as axial_montage.jpg.  First change the save
      format from ppm to jpg, then save the image.  After that, view the image,
      just to be sure it looks as expected.  To view, either use some other
      image viewer or AFNI's aiv program (AFNI image viewer).

        - axial image: right-click on "Sav1.ppm"
        - change from Save.ppm to Save.jpg (for JPEG) (and Set)
        - axial iamge: left-click on Sav1.jpg
        - specify the prefix: axial_montage (and Set)

      There should have been a message on afni's terminal window about writing
      image to file axial_montage.jpg.  View the image, just to be sure.

        - command line: aiv axial_montage.jpg

   4. Get rid of image decorations and buttons in the Axial montage.

        - right-click in Axial image -> Image display

      Note that it is a toggle, and is re-displayed the same way.
