This is version 2.2 of the AFNI FATCAT (Functional And Tractographic
Connectivity Analysis Toolbox) demo set (Taylor & Saad, 2013, in Brain
Connectivity).

* In updating from v2.1 -> v2.2, the scripts around the ROI selection
  for post-FreeSurfer/connectomic tracking have changed.  There have
  also been a few naming changes, reflecting some changes in AFNI
  program functionality. *

This demo set consists of DWI and RS-FMRI data, as well as example
HARDI-reconstructions, some of which has been processed using AFNI,
FSL (such melodic for ICA), dcm2nii and DSI-Studio (for
HARDI-modeling) programs.

The FATCAT programs run from commandlines. Here, short examples and
scripts of several, but not all, programs and features are given in
the Do_* files. The primary purpose of these scripts is to provide a
number of realistic and/or didactic examples for using FATCAT programs
in MRI analysis. Thus, there are descriptions, musings and suggestions
in the comments in each Do_* file.

There are roughly three sets of analyses, which are not really
independent.  There is one for DTI, one for HARDI and one for RSFC.
Particularly for DTI and HARDI outputs, there are a number of script
examples for viewing results nicely in SUMA, courtesy of ZS
Saad. Users are encouraged to check the outputs of each program, even
when scripts are not given.

Work is currently being done for a tutorial using the
SUMA-visualization tools, though some scripts are provided here for
viewing features.  Additionally, work will continue on the HARDI
features, for example for including a more rigorous method for
treating directional uncertainty.

***********************************************************************

To run a script, one should simply be able to type, for example, the
following in a commandline:
$ tcsh Do_01_RUNdti_convert_grads.tcsh
or
$ ./Do_01_RUNdti_convert_grads.tcsh
and similarly for each Do_* file.

Some of these scripts use existing AFNI programs, such as 3dDWItoDT
and 3dcalc, as well.  They should generally be run in the order of
enumeration (first Do_01*, then Do_02*, etc.) since outputs from some
steps become inputs for others. If you want a shortcut to run all
calculations-scripts, but not the visualization ones, then run
Do_00_PRESTO*.tcsh.  Even so, it's worth reading through some of the
comments and descriptions in the comments of each file.  

Questions/comments/suggestions are always welcome, either on the AFNI 
Message Board website, or via email:

                                      performed in AFNI/FATCAT, there isn't a
