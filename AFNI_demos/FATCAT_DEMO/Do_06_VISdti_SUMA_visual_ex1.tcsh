We begin with a simple look at the tracts.\n\
Right-click on the tracts to select a location along them.\n\
This would make AFNI jump to the same location if the two\n\
programs are talking. Press 't' in SUMA to get them talking\n\
and try the selections again.\n\n\
Open the tract controller via View --> Object Controllers or (ctlr+s)\n\
and select a location on the tract.\n\n\
           InstaTract - interactive mask selection\n\n\
Create a a mask by clicking on Masks in the tract controller.\n\
This creates a masking sphere and only tracts going through it are\n\
displayed. To move the sphere right-double click on it to place SUMA\n\
in 'Mask Manipulation Mode' which is indicated by displaying the ball\n\
in mesh mode (see help in SUMA, (ctrl+h), for details.).\n\
Selecting a location on the tracts, the slices, or surfaces, will make\n\
the ball jump to that location. The mask should also be visible in AFNI\n\
and clicking in AFNI will make the mask move in SUMA also.\n\n\
To turn off 'Mask Manipulation Mode' right-double click in open air, or on\n\
the ball itself.\n\
\n\
Another click on Masks will also open the masks controller, which allows\n\
for complex masking configurations.\n\
\n\
Hit OK when done playing with whole brain tracts.\n\
The next example will look at tracts going through the DMN.\n"`
