# Mini-probabilistic tracking example: this method uses deterministic
# tractography + a simple extension of including few Monte Carlo
# iterations of perturbed tensor values (via uncertainty estimations).
# This can be useful to get a broader (more robust?) sense of tract
# locations, intermediate to (and faster than) full probabilistic
# tracking itself-- hence it is referred to as the
# `mini-probabilistic' option.  The same deterministic algorithm
# options from before are used.

# Previously, in Do_05*.tcsh, we looked at AND-logic connections among
# the four networks of interest. Let's do a few iterations in MINIP
# mode, and compare results.
